### **Objective Statement:**

**What are you trying to answer with this prototype?**

* The prototype explores how players engage in meaningful and difficult relationships with environmental factors. It specifically seeks to respond to the following question: How does pushing a boulder up a mountain mentally and physically engage players? It will also explore the ways in which environmental resistance—weight, slope, and obstacles—can elicit feelings of struggle, tension, and tenacity.

### **Design Rationale:**

* **Experience Envisioned**: The goal of the design is to create a fully immersive experience based on the myth of Sisyphus, that makes the player's journey seem both mentally and physically demanding. This physically demanding mechanic will present an emotional assessment, highlighting resilience in the face of hardship.  
* **Innovative/Experimental Aspects**:  
  * *Environmental Resistance: Challenging aspects of the environment include geographical difficulty, gravity, and natural obstacles.*  
  * *Dynamic Environment: The player is forced to adjust their plans as the environment intentionally works against them by creating unpredictability.*  
  * *Emotional Engagement: By replicating physical strain and letting players feel the weight of the work, we hope to elicit emotional engagement through frustration and the realization that the boulder falls down rendering their progress meaningless.*  
  * *Over other games with a similar narrative and design; it is worth noting that this is the first version, I’m aware of, that uses a first person camera view in its gameplay.*
